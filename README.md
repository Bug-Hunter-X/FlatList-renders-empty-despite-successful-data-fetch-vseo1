# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native fails to render data even after a successful fetch, despite correctly handling loading and error states. The issue is subtly related to how data is updated and rendered within the component's lifecycle.

## Bug Description

The `DataFetch` component fetches data from a public API. While the loading and error states are properly managed, the FlatList remains blank even when the data is successfully retrieved. This inconsistency arises from a potential timing or update issue in the component's rendering cycle.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the application using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe that the FlatList remains blank, even after successful API data retrieval.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `DataFetchSolution.js`. The fix involves ensuring the `data` state is updated correctly and using the `extraData` prop in the FlatList to force re-rendering.
